    <td>Finished cutting point assembly should look like this. Note: for titanium backers, the backer should be centered between belt clamps and the end of the depressor mount should be flush with the end of the backer. This will work for all backers with 10/20/40mm spacing with the furthest back hole 5-15mm from the end. Height of depressor should be adjusted to press in the depression on the cutting arm and the BHCS can be adjusted in and out for the right positioning and locked in place with the M3 nut</td>
