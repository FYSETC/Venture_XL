## Toolheads
Currently ERF is only available for the Stealthburner toolhead. We hope to offer other options in the future. When choosing toolhead sensors "types" refer to the explanation of options [here](/Recommended_Options/Toolhead_Modifications/README.md#possible-options-explained).



### Parts list - considering you already have a Stealthburner with Dragon Hotend

#### Toolhead: 
- Loctite
- 1x M3 nut (DIN934; idealy a countersunk tool to modify the nut for proper filament insertion)
- 2x M3 washer (0.5mm)
- 1x M3x18 SHCS (it repleaces the top left M3x25 SHCS from the SB-Cover mount) 
- 2x Voron heat inserts
- 1x M3x18 FHCS (counter sunk screw)
- 1x M3x8 SHCS
- 1x M2.5x16 SHCS (15-18mm works)
- Spring 0.4x4x15 or alternative of ballpoint pen (L=15mm; D<=4,5mm) (I've ordered some for testing, to have a "defined" spring)
- Type 4 metal hobby blades (we will cut it to length) [Link](https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005005117830095.html?spm=a2g0o.order_detail.order_detail_item.9.47c26368QwSbBr&gatewayAdapt=glo2deu) Amazon link, these need glue to be held in but work fine (USA) [Link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QP8L1QG)

    <td width=40%><img src="Assets/Depressor_Mount.png" alt='Depressor'></td>
    <td>Finished cutting point assembly should look like this. Note: for titanium backers, the backer should be centered between belt clamps and the end of the depressor mount should be flush with the end of the backer. This will work for all backers with 10/20/40mm spacing with the furthest back hole 5-15mm from the end. Height of depressor should be adjusted to press in the depression on the cutting arm and the BHCS can be adjusted in and out for the right positioning and locked in place with the M3 nut</td>
