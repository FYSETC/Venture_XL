# Introduction

The Venture XL, a 600mm3 coreXY printer kit, is inspired by the classic VORON V2.4. The key components of this kit are high-precision CNC-machined parts, demonstrating outstanding quality. Meanwhile, it comes with the necessary printing components and tools considerately, and the print head and control box have been pre - assembled, enabling you to start the installation process effortlessly without the need to prepare additional parts. Once the installation is completed, you can immediately engage in the printing work and enjoy an efficient and convenient printing experience.

It is equipped with a 550Mhz H723 single - chip microcomputer, an RK3568 with 4 cores at 2.0GHz, 2GB + 32GB for the host computer, a TMC5160 high - performance stepper motor driver, and a 7 - inch high - definition capacitive touch screen. With a printing speed of up to 500m/s and an acceleration of 50000, it not only brings an extremely fast printing experience but also creates a comfortable operation feeling for you.

The size of the machine frame is designed with reserved installation spaces for IDEX and AWD, providing you with broad possibilities for upgrade and modification, which is highly playable. Whether you are pursuing higher performance or personalized customization, you can find satisfaction here.

In addition, the complete enclosure design provides an insulated space for the printer, effectively maintaining the stability of the printing environment. At the same time, it also has powerful air - purification capabilities. It can support the printing of various consumables and, more importantly, minimize the potential threat of plastic particles to your health to the greatest extent, creating a safe and comfortable printing environment for you.

## Mechanical

- Super large size: 900x900x900mm, can meet AWD or IDEX upgrade modification;

- Enclosed cavity, more materials can be printed, healthier printing method, the box is sealed by segmented assembly, easy to install and ensure structural strength;

- Compatible with Nevermore StealthMax air filter, the air quality in the box is guaranteed to be pollution-free when the box is sealed;

- 4040 aluminum profile frame, light and high strength;

- CNC precision-machined independent four-zone printing platform, can be fine-tuned according to flatness;

- Drag chain system;

- 12mm linear guide, 9mm super wear-resistant belt;

- Aluminum alloy external electric control box that can be placed arbitrarily (left/right/back), connect the line;

- CNC aluminum alloy link components to ensure the structural strength of the equipment;

- Z-axis 27:1 reduction motor ensures that the Z-axis is more stable and does not slip when the machine is running or stopped;

- IDMCNC metal bracket can withstand high temperature challenges and ensure stability. In a high-temperature printing environment, it will not deform or fail, ensuring long-lasting and reliable performance. The bracket weighs only 26g, which is lighter than TAP leveling and old-style proximity switches. The bracket weighs only 26g, which is lighter than TAP leveling and old-style proximity switches, reducing inertia and improving speed, accuracy and printing quality;

- Can hang 5KG large rolls of consumables, and there is no need to frequently replace consumables during printing;

- 40KG load Foma wheel allows the equipment to be stationed and transported at any time

# Known issue

1.  Instructions for use of motor connection wire:
    Z0 and Z3 motors need to use 3.5m connecting wires, Z1 motor uses 1.85m connecting wires, and the connecting wires of Z2 motor and B motor are swapped to solve the problem of short connecting wire of B motor. A Motor connection line remains unchanged
